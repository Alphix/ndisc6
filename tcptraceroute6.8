.SH NAME
tcptraceroute6 \- TCP/IPv6 traceroute tool
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BR "tcptraceroute6" " [" "-n" "] [" "-f min_hop" "] [" "-m max_hop" "] ["
.BR "-q attempts" "] [" "-w wait" "] <" "hostname/address" "> [" "port" "]"

.SH DESCRIPTON
.B tcptraceroute6
is an IPv6 traceroute implementation using TCP packets.

It displays the list of hops along the network route between the local system
and specified destination, by sending packets while incrementing their hop
limit, until the final destination is reached.

.SH OPTIONS

.TP
.BR "\-f" "
Override the initial IPv6 packets hop limit (default: 1).

.TP
.BR "\-h"
Display some help and exit.

.TP
.BR "\-m"
Override the maximum hop limit (maximum number of hops).
The default is 30 hops which should be sufficient on the IPv6 Internet for
some time.

.TP
.BR "\-n"
Do not try to resolve each hop's IPv6 address to a host name. That may speed
up the traceroute significantly.

.TP
.BR "\-q"
Override the number of probes sent to each hop (default: 3).

.TP
.BR "\-V" " or " "\-\-version"
Display program version and license and exit.

.TP
.BR "\-w"
Override the delay (in seconds) to wait for response once a given probe packet
was sent (default: 5 seconds).

.SH SECURITY
.RI "tcptraceroute6 should be " "setuid" " " "root" " to allow use by non "
privileged users. It will drop its root privileges before any attempt
is made to send or receive data from the network so as to reduce the possible
impact of a security vulnerability.

.SH "SEE ALSO"
traceroute6(8), tcptraceroute(8), ipv6(7)
