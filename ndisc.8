.SH NAME
ndisc \- ICMPv6 Neighbor Discovery tool
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BR "ndisc" " [" "-qv" "] [" "-r attempts" "] [" "-w wait_ms" "] <"
.BR "IPv6 address" "> <" "iface" ">"

.SH DESCRIPTON
.B NDisc
is an Unix program which implements the ICMPv6 Neighbor Discovery in
userland (it is normally done by the kernel). It is used to lookup the
link-layer address (layer 2 address, MAC in the case of Ethernet) of
any on-link IPv6 node.

The IPv6 address of the node must specified, as well as the networking
interface on which to perform the lookup.

.SH OPTIONS

.TP
.BR "\-h" " or " "\-\-help"
Display some help and exit.

.TP
.BR "\-q" " or " "\-\-quiet"
Only display link-layer address. Display nothing in case of failure.
That is mostly useful when calling the program from a shell script.

.TP
.BR "\-r attempts" " or " "\-\-retry attempts"
Send ICMPv6 Neighbor Discovery that many times until a reply is
received, or abort. By default, ndisc will try 3 times before aborting.

.TP
.BR "\-w wait_ms" " or " "\-\-wait wait_ms"
.RI "Waits " "wait_ms" " milliseconds for a response before retrying."
By default, ndisc waits 1 second between each attempts.

.TP
.BR "\-V" " or " "\-\-version"
Display program version and license and exit.

.TP
.BR "\-v" " or " "\-\-verbose"
Display verbose information. That is the default.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS

If you get no response while you know the remote host is up, it is
most likely that it is not on-link, that is to say, you must cross one
or more routers to reach it. By design, IPv6 nodes ignore ICMPv6
Neighbor Discovery packets received from nodes not on the same link
(i.e. Ethernet segment), for the sake of security. Technically, that is
done by ensuring that the Hop limit (TTL) is 255.

Note that you cannot use ndisc to lookup the local host's link-layer
address.

.SH BUGS
In the case of very high traffic on the networking interface, ndisc may
wait for more than 1 second (or the time specified through the \-\-wait
option).

.SH SECURITY
.RI "ndisc should be " "setuid" " " "root" " to allow use by non "
privileged users. It will drop its root privileges before any attempt
is made to send or receive data from the network to reduce the possible
impact of a security vulnerability.
