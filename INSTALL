Basic Installation
==================

  A Makefile is provided. It supports the common targets to build
(make all), install (make install or make install-strip), and uninstall
(make uninstall) the program from source.

  You can also override the default compiler (gcc) and compilers flags
with the CC and CFLAGS variable, as usual.

Note for non GNU-based systems
==============================

  The Makefile is meant for use with GNU Make. If you are on *BSD, you
will hence need to call "gmake" (and possibly install) rather than the
BSD Make.
