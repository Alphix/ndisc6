.SH DESCRIPTON

.TP
.BR "\-n" " or " "\-\-numeric"
Prevent forward hostname lookup.
This ensures that the input names are numeric addresses, which do not need
to be looked up. Typically used along with the \-\-reverse option to convert
numerical addresses to canonical hostnames.

.TP
.BR "\-r" " or " "\-\-reverse"
Perform a reverse DNS lookup
.RB "(enabled implicitly with " "addrinfo" ")."
.BR "addrinfo" " prints numerical resolved addresses by default instead."

.TP
