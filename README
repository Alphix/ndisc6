NDisc : ICMPv6 Discovery tool
==============================
$Id$
Copyright (C) 2005 Remi Denis-Courmont.

  That package is made of a single source code file which produces two
different binary executables :
- ndisc6, which performs ICMPv6 Neighbor Discovery in userland,
- rdisc6, which performs ICMPv6 Router Discovery in userland.

  For detailled usage instructions, you should refer to the Unix manual
pages ndisc6(8) and rdisc6(8) which should be provided with your copy of
the program.

  A Makefile is provided. It supports the common targets to build
(make all), install (make install or make install-strip), and uninstall
(make uninstall) the program from source.

  This package is distributed under the terms of the General Public
License (GPL) version 2 written by the Free Software Foundation, Inc.
