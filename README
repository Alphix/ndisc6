NDisc6 : IPv6 discovery tools
==============================
$Id$
Copyright (C) 2005 Remi Denis-Courmont.

  This package gathers a few diagnostic tools for IPv6 networks :
- ndisc6, which performs ICMPv6 Neighbor Discovery in userland,
- rdisc6, which performs ICMPv6 Router Discovery in userland,
- traceroute6, yet another IPv6 implementation of traceroute,
- tcptraceroute6, a TCP/IPv6-based traceroute implementation.

  For detailled usage instructions, you should refer to the Unix manual
pages ndisc6(8), rdisc6(8) and tcptraceroute6(8) which should be
provided with your copy of the program.
  For instructions on compilation and installation of the package,
refer to the provided INSTALL file.

Important portability note
==========================

  All programs are known to run on Linux (with either glibc or Âµclibc).
rdisc6 should also work on any BSD variant. ndisc6 won't compile on a
BSD system. tcptraceroute6 was not tested on BSD so far.
